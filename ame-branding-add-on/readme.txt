== Description ==

This add-on adds more branding features to Admin Menu Editor Pro. 

== Changelog ==

= 1.3 =
* Added a "login page title" setting that lets you change the title of the login page.
* Updated some settings page styles to match the admin interface changes introduced in WordPress 5.3.

= 1.2 =
* Added a "set external URL" option to all image settings. This lets you directly enter the image URL instead of selecting an image from the Media Library.
* Fixed this PHP notice: "login_headertitle is deprecated since version 5.2.0! Use login_headertext instead. Usage of the title attribute on the login logo is not recommended for accessibility reasons."
* Fixed the "hide admin footer" option not working with some themes that change #wpfooter styles.
* Fixed a conflict with Hide My WP Pro 3.0 that prevented the "Logo link URL" setting in the "Login" tab from having any effect.
* Tested up to WordPress 5.2.1.

= 1.1 =
* Added import/export support.
* The custom admin color scheme now also applies to the Toolbar (a.k.a. Admin Bar) on the site front end.

* Fixed a bug where the "Lost your password" form would display a message saying "lostpassword" instead of the standard password recovery message. 
* Tested with WP 4.9.5.

= 1.0 =
* Initial release.
